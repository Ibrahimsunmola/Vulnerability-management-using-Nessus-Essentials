<h1>Using Nessus for a vulnerability scan</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I will cover vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation. These are two of the main steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. I will be using Nessus Essentials to scan local VM hosted on Oracle VirtualBox in order run a basic network scan to discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of the vulnerabilities, then perform a rescan to verify remediation. 
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Nessus Essentials</b> 


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
First thing I will be doing is going to my virtual windows cmd on virtual box to get my IP address using the “ipconfig” command. <br/>

<br />
<br />
The next step is to ping the virtual machine IP address from my local machine just to make sure I can connect with the virtual machine.  <br/>

<br 

From the image above, I can see that I was not able to connect to the  virtual windows machine. I got a “request timeout” response. So therefore, I will need to disable the  firewall on the virtual windows machine.

To disable the firewall, I will need to open Microsoft common console document by typing the “wf.msc” command in the start box as seen in the image below. <br/>

I will then open the window defender firewall properties  <br/>

<br />
<br />
The next step is to turn off the Domain profile, private profile and public profile  <br/>

<a href="https://ibb.co/fr9kqW0"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/vLh3VWz/7.png" alt="7" border="0"></a>
<br />
<br />
After turning off the window defender, I will go back to local terminal and ping the window virtual IP address again. <br/>
<a href="https://ibb.co/YT5L8bq"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bR4KL78/8.png" alt="8" border="0"></a>
<br />
<br />
From the image above, I ran the “ping” command against THE windows virtual IP address again, and this time I Wwas able to connect to it.

The next step is to open the Nessus essentials, which is what I will be using to perform the vulnerability scan.  <br/>
<a href="https://ibb.co/7VNJDpM"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/3WYybF6/9.png" alt="9" border="0"></a>
<br />
<br />
I will be creating a new scan which can be found at the top right corner of the Nessus essentials app.

<br />
<br />
From the image above, I will be running a basic network scan.

<a href="https://ibb.co/HH4ssGM"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/6WwxxDp/11.png" alt="11" border="0"></a>

From the image above, I am about to run a basic network scan on the virtual windows machine. 
I have the name of the scan as “windows 10 scan” and I've also input the ip address of the virtual machine.
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://ibb.co/T2Fv0m9"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/yPbfkWH/13.png" alt="13" border="0"></a>

The basic network scan has been completed and we can see the result. We have a risk indicator by the bottom right corner that shows the level of threats from critical to info by colour.

From the result of the scan, we have 1 medium threat and 30 infos. In the next image, I will be expanding the results to see the vulnerabilities that has been detected.

<a href="https://ibb.co/RjtgrPN"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/1zB0yKM/15.png" alt="15" border="0"></a>
The image above is the expanded result of the scan and we can the medium threat that has been identified is an “SMB signing not required”

The other threats are classified as info because they do not pose a threat but we should be aware of.

<br />
<br />
<a href="https://ibb.co/DpRfLk5"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/m8c5St6/16.png" alt="16" border="0"></a>
Going into the “SMB signing not required” vulnerability, the threat means an attacker can conduct a man-in-the-middle attack against the SMB server. 

 A man-in-the-middle attack is a type of attack in which an attacker sits between the conversation of a user and an application with aim of acquiring credentials.

We are been given a solution that can be used to rectify the vulnerability, which is “enforcing message signing in the hosts configuration. 

The next step is to perform remediation on the virtual window machine by implementing the solution that is given from the result of the scan.

 To able to perform the remediation, I need to access the “policy settings” on the virtual windows machine by typing the command “secpol.msc” in the start box as seen in the image below.
 <br />
 <br />
 <a href="https://ibb.co/8rYBf29"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/T4WT7Rt/17.png" alt="17" border="0"></a>
  <br />
 <br />
 The next step is to access the security settings then access the local policies then access the security options then navigate to Microsoft network server and enable it.

 <a href="https://ibb.co/4Nj49KK"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Ky9VRbb/19.png" alt="19" border="0"></a>
 From the image above I have enabled the Microsoft network server.

The next is run the basic network scan on our virtual windows machine and see if the solution provided was correct.

<a href="https://ibb.co/d52tYRw"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/VqSx4sc/20.png" alt="20" border="0"></a>

From the image above, the scan has been completed and we do not have the medium threat of SMB again. Which means that I have successfully remediated the vulnerability threat.

## CONCLUSION

In conclusion, I was able to successfully run a vulnerability scan using Nessus essentials against a virtual windows machine and also fixed the vulnerability that was discovered by simply following the solution that was provided.
